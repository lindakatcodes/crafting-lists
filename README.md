# Crafting Lists

Create your own crafting lists for Lego Fortnite! Select the high level items you want to build or upgrade, and a list will be generated for you with all the recipes and raw materials you'll need to build everything.

## Built With:

- Astro
- Vue
- Tailwind
- Shadcn-vue
- Astra DB
- Netlify

Also special shout outs to some example code that helped me scrap the data I wanted and get AstraDB set up:

### Notes of Future Plans

I want to add more items for this main collection, but I also want to improve this to allow for storing lists of items and having more games available to build lists of items for. This is just a small mvp to get started! 

Some Lego Fortnite reference links I still want to add:
